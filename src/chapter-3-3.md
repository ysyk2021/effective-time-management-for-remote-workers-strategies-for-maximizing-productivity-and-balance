Setting SMART Goals

- **Relevant**: Make sure your goal is relevant to your job responsibilities or personal aspirations.
- **Time-bound**: Set a specific deadline for achieving your goal.

By setting SMART goals, remote workers can focus on their priorities, stay motivated, and achieve better results.
