* **Break Projects into Tasks**: Break down projects into smaller, manageable tasks with clear deadlines. Use your chosen tools to assign tasks, set due dates, and track progress.

Implement Time Tracking Techniques
----------------------------------

* **Track Time Spent on Tasks**: Record the time spent on different tasks or activities throughout the day. This practice increases awareness of how you allocate your time and helps identify productivity patterns.

Measure Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
-----------------------------------------

* **Identify Areas for Improvement**: Identify areas where you can improve in terms of efficiency, quality, or effectiveness. Use these insights to refine your future approaches.

Seek Feedback and Input
-----------------------

* **Engage in 360-Degree Feedback**: Request feedback from colleagues, clients, or supervisors regarding your performance and progress. This input can provide valuable insights and highlight blind spots.
